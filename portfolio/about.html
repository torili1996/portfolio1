		<p1>I am Yuerong Li and you can call me Tori. I am originally from Beijing, China and has studied in New York and Berlin in the past four years. As a freelance photographer, I have worked for a wide range of clients from individuals to agencies. My independent practices focus mostly on photography, graphic design and website design. This website shows a selection of my work from the last few years. </p1>
