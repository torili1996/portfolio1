				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>I have been very intrigued by trees and the relationship they have with their surroundings; the impact they have on the environment in which they exist and the influence that the environment has on their existence. It seems that with modern technology and the rapid developments that are occurring in our society, trees have taken a less important place in our lives. However, I believe that trees have a greater meaning and place in the quotidian from a natural and cultural view. </p> </section>
			<section class="text">
				<h3>Inspiration</h3> 
				<p>One thing I had observed during my trip to Rome were the trees which reminded me of the ones I saw in Dali, China. Both appear to be so unique in personality that I couldn’t help but be distracted from the architecture to take a closer look at these natural majestical figures. Thus, I suppose that trees could serve as a universal language, which could bring people from diverse cultural backgrounds to a common place. Also inspired by artworks including David Freund-Gas Stop, Stephen Shore- American Surfaces, and Diane Cook and Len Jenshel’s photography book-Wise Trees.</p></section>

				<h3>Process</h3> 
				<p>These pictures were made during my trips across the globe within diverse environments including urban cities, rural villages, coastal towns, national parks, etc. It is a combination of film photography and digital photography.

				<h3>Concept</h3> 
				<p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. Plastics are an abstract assimilation of trees for their similar uses and their derivable. Inclusion of empty chairs serves as a link for the audience to imagine themselves within the same environment. This project aims to raise our awareness about trees, their complex convergence with humans both naturally and culturally, and to honor their existence. They stand still, watch silently, witness the everlasting changes, and help us to learn about scale.

			<p>Seeing Myself is a film photography collection of thirteen self-portraits that were taken over the past four years crossing five countries. They are divided into three groups based on my judgment of  privacy, intimacy and security during the shooting. Group A: indoor by myself - I felt secure, relaxed and spent much longer time framing and posing; Group B: outdoor by myself- I emphasized more on the setting and pretended that I was still shooting even if I had already pressed the shutter-release button when people walking by; Group C: companioned by friends- pictures were often an instant catch and were developed and scanned first due to my high expectation and deep curiosity. Every photograph, as my inner image and private image, testifies my self-consciousness and self-awareness. As both the spectator and the subject, I face myself through the reflection and at the same time, initiate my intuition and artistic creation. </p></section>
