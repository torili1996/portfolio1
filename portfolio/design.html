				<h5>Background</h5>
				<p>“Intangible cultural heritage is a representation, expression, skill, instrument and many other forms of a place’s cultural heritage”(Sullivan, 2016). Much of the Chinese intangible cultural heritage has disappeared in the last decades due to technological developments and its inability to adjust to our current life.  Intangible cultural heritage is often performed in a way of inheriting which creates great risks of distinction. In most cases, craftsmanship is taught only within a specific family or a town or an ethnicity. Existing projects and work of ICH are mostly documentaries, which are powerful but not much plausible for daily uses.  </p> 
		
				<h5>Inspiration</h5> 
				<p>Masters in Forbidden City, a documentary about the stories of restorers working inside the Forbidden City and Looking for Craftsmanship  are two documentaries that raised my interest and curiosity in culture restoration. Makeup is a feasible and outstanding way of combining these intangibles with products that can be used every day. Makeup prototypes are inspired by Pat McGrath, Marc Jacobs, Chanel and Lime Crime. </p>
		
				<h5>Purpose</h5> 
				<p>ichChina is an exploration of the modern application of  intangible cultural heritage in China from a young, creative and artistic perspective. The main application I created is makeup prototypes which are inspired by three Chinese intangible cultural heritage: Miao Embroidery, Silver Inlaid Black Copper and The Has’ Kites. This project aims to raise people’s awareness of culture preservation, and to bring those traditional cultural heritage to modern uses within a global environment. I also hope my project can attract more young people to participate in learning those skills, craftsmanship and languages so we can keep ICH alive. </p>
				
				<h5>Example</h5> 
				<p>Silver Inlaid Black Copper is a technique with “a history of 300 years and originates from Yunnan province, China” (Silver Inlaid Black Cooper, Google Art and Culture). The process is laborious, boring and difficult but the result is extraordinarily beautiful. The silver inlaying on black copper is absolutely a highlight. Therefore, highlighter palettes will be the makeup prototype for this technique . Both the inner and outside cover are futuristic and metallic, including patterns from “the Vase of Fortune and Longevity Featuring Plum Blossom, Orchid, Bamboo and Chrysanthemum” made by Jin Yongcai, the only sixth inheritor of this craftsmanship. Holographic colors such as green, purple, orange, and silver are the main colors since the original color of copper is pinkish orange and will turn into green after being exposed to moisture. </p>

		<h5>Background</h5>
	<p1>Sophie is the main character from Howl’s Moving Castle, the Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. She is an 18-year-old girl but gets cursed by a powerful witch and becomes a 90-year-old woman and can’t tell anyone about the curse. She flees to a moving castle of a wizard named Howl, works there as the cleaning lady and gets caught up in his resistance to fight for the king. Sophie and Howl fall in love through their resistance to war and the evil witch. castleStay will be an official website of Howl and Sophie’s moving castle, where they host eclectic styles of accommodation and experience. 
</p1>
		</section>
	
		<section class="text">
		<h5>Inspiration</h5>
	<p1>Inspired by Airbnb and Hyori's Homestay. As a moving castle, there will be different styles of homes including: movie's original style, Japanese style, Greek style and My Neighbor Totoro style, etc. Experiences such as learning magic from Howl, hat design with Sophie, cooking class, picnic and stargazing will be provided. </p1>
		</section>
			
		<section class="text">
		<h5>Concept Goal</h5>
	<p1>castleStay aims to bring people to the magical universe of the film in which they can imagine themselves meeting the characters and experiencing their life. Howl's Moving Castle has been one of my favorite movies for years and I have always dreamed of visiting their world. Within this charming fantasy, I saw the beauty and power of vibrant courage and delight of love. Over the years, I have been healed and impressed every time I watch it. castleStay is my fantasy of the movie and I wish it could become true one day.
